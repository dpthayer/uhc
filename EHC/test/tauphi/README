TyCore test files
=================

These files serve to test some of the TyCore tranformations.
They're all designed to work with variant 8 of the compiler, i.e. no IO.


defsitearity-*
Tests the DefinitionSiteArityRaise transformation

  1: Simple curried function `const`, both parameters can be merged.
  2: Polymorphic `id` function, explicit type parameter can be merged with
     value parameter.
  3: Complex function `foo`, with nested let bindings. Several value
     parameters can be merged.


lazyfun-*
Tests the RemoveLazyFunctions transformation.

  1: Test top level and let bound functions. Also tests CAFs.
  2: Tests non-function with function type (undefined).


strictness-*
Tests the OptimizeStrictness transformation.

  1: Monomorphic `id` function with @strict annotation.
  2: Monomorphic `id` function with one @strict annotation, nice to test with
     DefinitionSiteArityRaise transformation.
  3: `succ` function wth @strict annotation.
     At the time of writing, FFI isn't properly implemented in TypeChecker, so
     that still gives an error.
  4: The `foo` function is intended to show the concept of deep-unboxing.
     However, since data types aren't yet implemented, this doesn't work.
