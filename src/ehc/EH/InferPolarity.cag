Polarities:

  There are three basic polarities (covariant, contravariant and invariant), functions (for higher-order types),
  polymorhpism and negation (also for higher-order types).

  Pol ::=   Covariant
        |   Contravariant
        |   Invariant
        |   Var
        |   Forall var . Pol
        |   Pol -> Pol
        |   Negate Pol

  A polarity is inferred for each type constructor by traversing the data type declarations. Such a
  polarity does not contain the Covariant and Contravariant alternative.
  
  A polarity is normalized after applying the following rules exhaustively to each sub-structure:
  
    Negate (Negate p)    = p
    Negate Covariant     = Contravariant
    Negate Contravariant = Covariant
    Negate Invariant     = Invariant
    
  Polarities are required to be in normalized form. This is achieved by running the normalization
  procedure after applying a substitution.
  
  The build-in type constructors have the following polarities:
  
    Int, Bool, Char, Float  ::: Forall Delta . Delta
    Maybe, ([]) ::: Forall Delta . Delta -> Delta
    (->) ::: Forall Delta . Negate Delta -> Delta


Unify rules:

  The following description implies a predicative type system 

    mgu p1 p2
      | p1 == p2     = emptySubst
    mgu (Var v) p
      | v `occurs` p = singleSubst v Invariant
      | otherwise    = singleSubst v p
    mgu p (Var v)
      | v `occurs` p = singleSubst v Invariant
      | otherwise    = singleSubst v p
    mgu (p1 -> p2) (p3 -> p4)
      = mgu p1 p3 ++ mgu p2 p4
    mgu (Negate p1) (Negate p2)
      = mgu p1 p2
  
  And some subtyping rules:
      
    mgu Covariant Invariant     = Invariant
    mgu Contravariant Invariant = Invariant
  
  (do we need direction here?)

  At first sight, the following cases seem reasonable as well, but should not be added:

    mgu Covariant Contravariant = Invariant
    mgu Contravariant Covariant = Invariant

  Adding these cases breaks the invariant that bindings discovered for polarity variables may only
  be changed into something more specific.
  
  Other cases are considered to be an error. Features such as polarity signatures or kind polymorphism will likely
  cause such cases to exist.

Encoding of polarities:

  The polarities are internally encoded using the Ty Abstract Syntax, to allow reuse of functionality that is already
  available for types.

  Covariant, Invariant, Contravariant:

    Ty_Con "Covariant", Ty_Con "Invariant", Ty_Con "Contravariant"

  Var, Forall:
  
    Ty_Var, Ty_Quant
  
  Arrow:

    Ty_App (Ty_App (Ty_Con "->"))
  
  Negate:
  
    Ty_App (Ty_Con "Negate")
  
  With this encoding, fitsIn satisfies the above mgu-definition, except for the negation
  magic. That is to be placed in the part that combines subsitutions.

%%% Introduction

  Some examples. Todo: convert to english.

    data GRose f a = Branch a (f (GRose f a))

  Intern krijg je na een paar stappen:

    f :: v1 -> v2
    a :: v2

  Waardoor GRose intern het type:

    GRose :: (v1 -> v2) -> v2 -> v2

  krijgt. En een paar stappen later wordt voor f gevonden:

    f :: v2 -> v2

  Zodat voor generalisatie:

    GRose :: (v2 -> v2) -> v2 -> v2

  Zodat er voor GRose gevonden wordt:

    GRose :: forall d . (d -> d) -> d -> d


  Interessanter is:

    data GRose' f a = Branch (f a (GRose' f a))

  Daarvoor vind je:

    f :: v2 -> v1 -> v1
    a :: v2

    GRose' :: forall d1 d2 . (d2 -> d1 -> d1) -> d2 -> d1

  Wanneer je dan de volgende type expressie gaat typeren:

    GRose' (->) Int

  instantiaties:

    GRose' :: (Negate v1 -> v1 -> v1) -> Negate v1 -> v1
    (->) :: Negate v1 -> v1 -> v1
    Int :: Negate v1

  v1 is de 'root' co/contravariantie dus Covariant, dus:

    GRose' :: (Contra -> Co -> Co) -> Contra -> Co
    (->) :: Contra -> Co -> Co
    Int :: Contra

  Terwijl voor:

    GRose' (,) Int

  instantiaties:

    GRose' :: (v1 -> v1 -> v1) -> v1 -> v1
    (,) :: v1 -> v1 -> v1
    Int :: v1

  Zodat alles covariant is.


  Tot slot nog een geval met een conflict:

    data C a = Con (a -> a)

  Daarvoor:

    a :: v2
    C :: v2 -> v1
    (->) :: Negate v1 -> v1 -> v1

  Zodat:

    a :: v1
    a :: Negate v1

  Dit geeft (v1 = Negate v1) wat v1 afbeeld op Invariant, zodat:

    a :: Invariant
    C :: Invariant -> Invariant

  Om dit laatste goed te typeren heb ik subtyping nodig, zodat ik moet toevoegen:

    fitsIn Covariant Invariant = Invariant
    fitsIn Contravariant Invariant = Invariant
    (afzwakken naar Invariant)



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Inferencing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  Inferencing procedure: assume for each type expression that there is some known polarity
  context. This context is Covariant for the outermost type expression of type signatures,
  and some polarity variable delta for the outermost type expression of fields of a
  data constructor (whose actual context is known only at places where the corresponding
  type constructor is used). For subexpressions, the context is inferred from the known
  context and polarity signatures of type constructors.
  
  The inference here is performed on Ty_Exprs. A similar procedure is required to use the
  results for Tys. However, this procedure is less complicated since type variables do not
  have to be taken into account and the signature for each type constructor is known
  (available through finPolGam).
  
  Essentially, the inference process is just regular 'kind' inference, with a very basic
  subtyping. The key difference is the Negation-construct and normalization.

%%% Polarity propagation

  First the polarity as known at the root of a type expression. As mentioned before, for
  the roots of type expressions in a data type, this is some polarity variable. This will
  be the result-part of the polarity of the type constructor. For other type expressions in
  the AST, the context is covariant at the root of the type expression.

%%[17 ag

      loc.polCtxVar    = mkPolVar @loc.lUniq4
      constrs.knPolCtx = @loc.polCtxVar

%%]

  Now we can define the polarity for sub expressions based on the above defined context.

  For applications, we proceed as follows. The left hand side of a type application is
  a function, so we pass as known polarity context a function. The argument part of this
  known polarity context is passed as the context for right right hand side of the
  type application. So, shape information is passed from top to the bottom left. Each
  type expression returns an inferred polarity 'pol', originally obtained at the
  bottom left from the polarity signature of type constructors or variables, and
  decomposed from left to right through function applications. During this process more
  information about polarity variables becomes available and is stored in substitutions
  along the way.

      func.knPolCtx = @loc.knFuncPol
      arg.knPolCtx  = @func.polVarMp |=> @loc.polArgVar
      lhs.pol       = @arg.polVarMp |=> @lhs.knPolCtx
%%]

  Type variable or type constructor: perform a lookup in the environment and match with
  the known context to instantiate the polarity signature.
  
  Name errors do not need to be reported. They are already reported by the kind inferencer.

      lhs.pol        = foTy @loc.foPol
%%]

  An analysis of the actual type expression of a wild card is needed to properly deal with
  it. To bypass this analysis, we assume that wildcards have kind star. Wildcards of higher
  kind are not supported by the code below.

%%[17 ag
SEM TyExpr
  | Wild VarWild
      lhs.pol = @lhs.knPolCtx
%%]

  For row types, the polarity of each member is the polarity of the entire row. The copy
  rule takes care of that.
  
  The Row, Impls and Pred cases have a zero-order kind. Therefore, the resulting polarity
  is the same as the context it appears in.

%%[17 ag
SEM TyExpr
  | Row Impls NoImpls Pred
      lhs.pol = @lhs.knPolCtx
%%]
  
  The same story is not the case for predicate expressions due to the arrow. The polarity
  switches for the argument. This is the only place where we have to introduce the
  negation explicitly. Normally, it is the instantiation of the polarity signature of the
  arrow type constructor that causes the introduction of negations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Substitution
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  Thread a substitution through the type expressions. A single substitution is threaded
  through an entire declaration group. This substitution can go through multiple
  data type declarations, type declarations, and other constructs containing type
  expressions. The polarity variables are chosen uniquely enough to not cause conflicts.

  Combine substitutions. For cyclic occurrences of v such that v = negate(v), v is mapped
