	    Utrecht Haskell Compiler -- second release 1.1.0
	    ================================================


The UHC team is happy to announce the second public release of the
Utrecht Haskell Compiler (UHC). UHC supports almost allmost all
Haskell98 and Haskell2010 features plus some experimental extensions. The
compiler runs on MacOSX, Windows (cygwin), and various Unix flavors.

This second release has the following highlights relative to the
previous first release:

  * Supports most of the Haskell2010 features.
  
  * Generic deriving [1].
  
  * UHC knows about packages, and Cabal version 1.9.3 and later have
    basic support for UHC, so that Cabal can be used to build UHC packages.
  
  * For the default backend libraries are provided until including
    package haskell98.
  
  * The runtime system is no longer dependent on Boehm garbage
    collector, but uses UHCs own, a swap space collector allowing
    parameterization with backend specifics.
  
  * More programs from the nofib test suite compile and run.
  
  * Many smaller and larger problems fixed.

Getting started & Download
--------------------------

UHC is available for download as source distribution via the UHC home
page:

	http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/UHC
	
Here you will also find instructions to get started and the specifics
of what UHC can and cannot do.


Status of the implementation
----------------------------

Over the past year much effort by many people has been put into
improving UHC, in particular to make it compile and run more library
modules and test programs. Although the UHC project is very much work in
progress overall reliability has improved, bugs have been fixed, and
some Hackage packages compile.


Warning
-------

Although we think that the compiler is stable enough to compile
substantial Haskell programs, we do not recommend yet to use it for any
serious development work in Haskell. We ourselves use the GHC as a
development platform! We think however that it provides a great platform
for experimenting with language implementations, language extensions,
etc.
