	Utrecht Haskell Compiler -- first release, version 1.0.0
	========================================================


The UHC team is happy to announce the first public release of the Utrecht Haskell
Compiler (UHC). UHC supports almost all Haskell98 features plus
experimental extensions. The compiler runs under MacOSX, Windows
(cygwin), and various Unix flavors.

Features:

    * Multiple backends, including a bytecode interpreter backend and a
      full program analysis backend, both via C.
      
    * Experimental language extensions, some of which have not been
      implemented before.
      
    * Implementation via attribute grammars and other high-level tools.
    
    * Compiler writers should be able to experiment realtively easily
      with different language variants, thanks to an aspect-oriented
      internal organisation.


Getting started & Download
--------------------------

UHC is available in source distribution, downloadable via the UHC home page:

	http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/UHC/WebHome
	
Here you will also find instructions to get started.



Status of the implementation
----------------------------

Like any compiler UHC is work in progress. Although we feel it is mature
enough to offer it for public availability, much work still needs to be
done, and we welcome contributions. UHC grew out of our Haskell compiler
project (called Essential Haskell Compiler, or EHC) over the past 5
years. UHC internally is organised as a combination of separate aspects,
which makes UHC also suitable for experimental use.
